Description: 'This note presents a search for the experimental signature of isolated photons, jets and high missing transverse momentum in excess of the Standard
    Model expectation in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. Such a final state may originate from supersymmetric models with gauge-mediated
    supersymmetry breaking in events where neutralinos decay into a photon and a gravitino. The search is performed using the dataset recorded with the ATLAS detector
    at the LHC in 2015 and early 2016, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 13.3 fb$^{-1}$.'

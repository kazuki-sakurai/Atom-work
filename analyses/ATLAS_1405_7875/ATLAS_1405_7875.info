Description: "A search for squarks and gluinos in final states containing high-$p_{\\rm T}$ jets, missing transverse momentum and no electrons or muons is presented. The data were recorded in 2012 by the ATLAS experiment in $\\sqrt{s}=8$ TeV proton--proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, with a total integrated luminosity of $20.3 \\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. No significant excess above the Standard Model expectation is observed. Results are interpreted in a variety of simplified and specific supersymmetry-breaking models assuming that $R$-parity is conserved and that the lightest neutralino is the lightest supersymmetric particle. An exclusion limit at the 95% confidence level on the mass of the gluino is set at 1330 GeV for a simplified model incorporating only a gluino and the lightest neutralino. For a simplified model involving the strong production of first- and second-generation squarks, squark masses below 850 GeV (440 GeV) are excluded for a massless lightest neutralino, assuming mass degenerate (single light-flavour) squarks. In mSUGRA/CMSSM models with $\\tan\\beta=30$, $A_0=-2m_0$ and $\\mu> 0$, squarks and gluinos of equal mass are excluded for masses below 1700 GeV. Additional limits are set for non-universal Higgs mass models with gaugino mediation and for simplified models involving the pair production of gluinos, each decaying to a top squark and a top quark, with the top squark decaying to a charm quark and a neutralino. These limits extend the region of supersymmetric parameter space excluded by previous searches with the ATLAS detector."

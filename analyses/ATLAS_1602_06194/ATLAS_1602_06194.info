Description: 'Results are reported of a search for new phenomena, such as supersymmetric
particle production, that could be observed in high-energy proton--proton
collisions. Events with large numbers of jets, together with missing transverse
momentum from unobserved particles, are selected. The data analysed were
recorded by the ATLAS experiment during 2015 using the 13 TeV centre-of-mass
proton--proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider, and correspond to an
integrated luminosity of 3.2 fb$^{-1}$. The search selected events with various
jet multiplicities from $\ge 7$ to $\ge 10$ jets, and with various $b$-jet
multiplicity requirements to enhance sensitivity. No excess above Standard
Model expectations is observed. The results are interpreted within two
supersymmetry models, where gluino masses up to 1400 GeV are excluded at 95%
confidence level, significantly extending previous limits.'

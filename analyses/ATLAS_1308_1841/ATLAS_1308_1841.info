Description: "A search is presented for new particles decaying to large numbers (7 to
greater or equal to 10) of jets, missing transverse momentum and no isolated
electrons or muons. This analysis uses 20.3/fb of pp collision data at
sqrt(s)=8 TeV collected by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider.
The sensitivity of the search is enhanced by considering the number of b-tagged
jets and the scalar sum of masses of large-radius jets in an event. No evidence
is found for physics beyond the Standard Model. The results are interpreted in
the context of various simplified supersymmetry-inspired models where gluinos
are pair produced, as well as a mSUGRA/CMSSM model."

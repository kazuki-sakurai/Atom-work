Description: 'Two searches for new phenomena in final states containing a same-flavour opposite-sign lepton (electron or muon) pair, jets, and large missing transverse
    momentum are presented. These searches make use of proton--proton collision data, collected during 2015 and 2016 at a centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV
    by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider, which correspond to an integrated luminosity of 14.7 fb$^{-1}$. Both searches target the pair production of
    supersymmetric particles, squarks or gluinos, which decay to final states containing a same-flavour opposite-sign lepton pair via one of two mechanisms: a leptonically
    decaying $Z$ boson in the final state, leading to a peak in the dilepton invariant mass distribution around the $Z$ boson mass; and decays of neutralinos (e.g.
    $\tilde{\chi}_2^0 \rightarrow \ell^+\ell^- \tilde{\chi}_1^0$), yielding a kinematic endpoint in the dilepton invariant-mass spectrum. The data are found to be
    consistent with the Standard Model expectation. Results are interpreted in simplified models of gluino (squark)-pair production, and provide sensitivity to gluinos
    (squarks) with masses as large as 1.7 TeV (980 GeV).'

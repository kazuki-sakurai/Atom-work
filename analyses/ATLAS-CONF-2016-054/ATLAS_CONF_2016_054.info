Description: 'The results of a search for squarks and gluinos in final states with an isolated electron or muon, multiple jets and large missing transverse momentum using proton--proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV are presented. The dataset used was recorded in 2015 and 2016 by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 14.8 fb$^{-1}$.'

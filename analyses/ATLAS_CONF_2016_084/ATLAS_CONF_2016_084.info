Description: 'We present a search for the pair production of resonances, each decaying into two jets. The analysis uses 15.4 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision
    data recorded at $\sqrt{s}$=13 TeV by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in 2015 and 2016. No significant excess is observed above the background prediction. The
    results are interpreted in a model with top squark pair production with R-parity violating decays into two quarks. Top squark masses between 250 and 405 GeV and
    between 445 and 510 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level. For the pair production of color octets with decays into two jets, masses from 250 to 1500 GeV are
    excluded at 95% confidence level.'

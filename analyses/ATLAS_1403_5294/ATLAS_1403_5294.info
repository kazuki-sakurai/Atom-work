Description: "Searches for the electroweak production of charginos, neutralinos and
sleptons in final states characterized by the presence of two leptons
(electrons and muons) and missing transverse momentum are performed using 20.3
fb-1 of proton-proton collision data at sqrt(s) = 8 TeV recorded with the ATLAS
experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. No significant excess beyond Standard
Model expectations is observed. Limits are set on the masses of the lightest
chargino, next-to-lightest neutralino and sleptons for different
lightest-neutralino mass hypotheses in simplified models. Results are also
interpreted in various scenarios of the phenomenological Minimal Supersymmetric
Standard Model."

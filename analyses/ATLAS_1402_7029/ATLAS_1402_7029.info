Description: "A search for the direct production of charginos and neutralinos in final states with three leptons and missing transverse momentum is presented. The analysis is based on 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ of $\\sqrt{s}$ = 8 TeV proton-proton collision data delivered by the Large Hadron Collider and recorded with the ATLAS detector. Observations are consistent with the Standard Model expectations and limits are set in $R$-parity-conserving phenomenological Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Models and in simplified supersymmetric models, significantly extending previous results.  For simplified supersymmetric models of direct chargino ($\\tilde\\chi^\\pm_1$) and next-to-lightest neutralino ($\\tilde{\\chi}_2^0$) production with decays to lightest neutralino ($\\tilde{\\chi}_1^0$) via either all three generations of sleptons, staus only, gauge bosons, or Higgs bosons, $\\tilde\\chi^\\pm_1$ and $\\tilde{\\chi}_2^0$ masses are excluded up to 700 GeV, 380 GeV, 345 GeV, or 148 GeV respectively, for a massless $\\tilde{\\chi}_1^0$."

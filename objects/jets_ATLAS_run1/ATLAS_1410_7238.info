Description: 'The production of a W boson decaying to e/nu or mu/nu in association with a W or Z boson decaying to two jets is studied using 4.6/fb of proton-proton collision data at sqrt(s) = 7 TeV recorded with the ATLAS  detector at the LHC.  The combined WW+WZ cross section is measured with a significance of 3.4 sigma and is found to be 68 +- 7 (stat.) +- 19 (syst.) pb, in agreement with the Standard Model expectation of  61.1 +- 2.2 pb. The distribution of the transverse momentum of the dijet system is used to set limits on anomalous contributions to the triple gauge coupling vertices and on parameters of an effective-field-theory model.'

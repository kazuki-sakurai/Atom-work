Description: 'Measurements of the $W^{\pm} \rightarrow \ell^{\pm} \nu$ and $Z \rightarrow
\ell^+ \ell^-$ production cross sections (where $\ell^{\pm}=e^{\pm},\mu^{\pm}$)
in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV are presented using data
recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, corresponding to
a total integrated luminosity of 81 pb$^{-1}$ The total inclusive
$W^{\pm}$-boson production cross sections times the single-lepton-flavour
branching ratios are $\sigma_{W^+}^{tot}= 11.83 \pm 0.02 (stat) \pm 0.32 (sys)
\pm 0.25 (lumi)$ nb and $\sigma_{W^-}^{tot} = 8.79 \pm 0.02 (stat) \pm 0.24
(sys) \pm 0.18 (lumi)$ nb for $W^+$ and $W^-$, respectively. The total
inclusive $Z$-boson production cross section times leptonic branching ratio,
within the invariant mass window $66  m_{\ell\ell}  116$ GeV, is
$\sigma_{Z}^{tot} = 1.981 \pm 0.007 (stat) \pm 0.038 (sys) \pm 0.042 (lumi)$
nb. The $W^+$, $W^-$, and $Z$-boson production cross sections and cross-section
ratios within a fiducial region defined by the detector acceptance are also
measured. The cross-section ratios benefit from significant cancellation of
experimental uncertainties, resulting in $\sigma_{W^+}^{fid}/\sigma_{W^-}^{fid}
= 1.295 \pm 0.003 (stat) \pm 0.010 (sys)$ and
$\sigma_{W^{\pm}}^{fid}/\sigma_{Z}^{fid} = 10.31 \pm 0.04 (stat) \pm 0.20
(sys)$. Theoretical predictions, based on calculations accurate to
next-to-next-to-leading order for quantum chromodynamics and to next-to-leading
order for electroweak processes and which employ different parton distribution
function sets, are compared to these measurements.'
